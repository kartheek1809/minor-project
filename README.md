# Malware_Classification using CNN

"Image-based classification of malware using deep learning" refers to a methodology that utilizes deep learning techniques to classify and detect malware samples based on their visual representations, which are typically derived from images or graphical representations of binary code or program behavior. This approach leverages the power of deep learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automatically learn relevant features from these visual representations and make accurate predictions about whether a given sample is malware or not.

The Dataset we used is Maling Dataset from Kaggle.

Do download that database from https://www.dropbox.com/s/ep8qjakfwh1rzk4/malimg_dataset.zip?dl=0

We can put our own data into the model by appending it to the downloaded dataset, provided you have already preprocessed the data using the code I've written.
